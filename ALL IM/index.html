            <p class="timeline__content-desc">
              TechKaro officially started to take students under its wings and
              teach them tech-craft from the 22nd February, 2018. This program
              is sponsored by EngroVopak, and teaches technological and life
              skills to young girls from underserved communities to upskill them
              and provide better earning opportunities. Our Web Development
              course is held over a period of 5 months, and is focused on
              development of programming skills along with website development.
              Students will learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. We keep
              rising above and beyond every year, and to-date we have graduated
              a total of 160 students from our Web Development course and have
              placed 73 of them in jobs in internships in notable places like
              SastaTicket, OutSprint, BMA Capital, Savvy, CodeUp and many more.

            </h2>
            <p class="timeline__content-desc">
              TechKaro went completely virtual in 2020, to keep its students
              safe and meet the needs of the governing policies. We slowly
              started adjusting to the new ‘norm’ of going online, and conducted
              our classes on Zoom while communicating with our students on
              Slack.

              Selection of the most fit candidate
            </h2>
            <p class="timeline__content-desc">
              All students have to go through a rigorous selection process that
              involves three distinct steps. This helps us ensure that we have
              selected the most deserving students who are confident and want to
              work in the same field. The first stage involves them studying a
              home study module that is sent over from our team. The second
              stage involves an online difficult test to assess their skills and
              knowledge about the module. The last step involves an interview
              with our instructors, this interview is to showcase their
              confidence and their willingness to learn

              First things first- The Orientation
            </h2>
            <p class="timeline__content-desc">
              In 2020, Techkaro conducted its opening orientation virtually,
              where students were introduced to the team, the instructors and to
              each other. Sadaffe Abid, Founder of CIRCLE, gave a speech and
              boosted the morale of the new-comers while explaining the vision
              and mission behind TechKaro. The team from ENGRO Foundation also
              joined in celebrating the admission of these successful students.

              The Web Development course happens twice a week and is about 4
              hours long. These classes are kept interactive so that students
              have fun while learning, and also understand key complex topics
              easily.

            <p class="timeline__content-desc">
              Life Skills are the building blocks of your professional lives.
              Even if you have the right skills related to technology, then you
              will need life skills to succeed. Some of the life skills we teach
              are Time Management, Resume Writing, Confidence and Resilience,
              Teamwork, Growth Mindset and much more. For our Coding batch of
              2020, we hosted a CV-Writing life skills session in collaboration
              with Amal Academy, where their instructors taught our students the
              art behind writing a professional CV. We would also like to thank
              the team from Engro for constantly supporting our students and
              helping them strengthen their skills

            <p class="timeline__content-desc">
              It is important to incorporate learnings into practise, and
              therefore we introduced two major projects that all students had
              to complete- midterm project and the final project. These two
              projects had a lot of weightage for students to graduate. The
              midterm project involved making an e-commerce website using the
              three front-end languages (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) that the
              students had learnt. Whereas, the final project was the core bit
              of TechKaro as students had to use Javascript library REACT to
              create a useful application.

              International Mentor Sessions for Coding Students
            </h2>
            <p class="timeline__content-desc">
              TechKaro Coding students had sessions with international mentors
              from Thoughtswork, Klarna, Code Sandbox and more where they
              showcased their projects and got feedback to incorporate in their
              future projects. These sessions help to make the students feel
              optimistic about their projects, and work on any lag that can make
              them better.

              Gearing up for the professional world
            </h2>
            <p class="timeline__content-desc">
              This is where we bid farewell to our promising students and set
              them out in the professional world. TechKaro’s team helps with the
              professional growth of the graduating students by hosting sessions
              that involve ‘interview readiness’, ‘creating a Linkedin profile’,
              ‘making an impact on the interviewers’, ‘adding weightage to your
              CV’, and many more. We also provide counselling sessions with team
              members to find out if the student is facing any difficulty or if
              they are having any problems in communication. New openings are
              shared with students so that they get inspired and keep applying.
              After the student lands a job/internship, we cover their stories
              for our social media and communicate with them on different
              occasions to see their growth in the organization
